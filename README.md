### Use

#### Login

For the sake of security I only have done OAuth this being my first project. Click on either Google or Facebook it will create an account for you if you don't have one already

The frist view you will see will look like this. This is where all of your existing lists will be. There will be one created for you by default with a bunch of helper items.
